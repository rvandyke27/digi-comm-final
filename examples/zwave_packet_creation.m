% 1. create n bit (or byte?) message (bit stream)

% 2. create modulated signal based on nrz coding 
 %print out chunk of frequency modulated message (waveform)
 
% 3. add preamble, SOF, EOF
 
% 4. sent at high frequency (according to MAC protocol)
%   indicate if there is a collision/succesful transmission of each
%   node/print other steps of MAC protocol process?

% 5. take first received signal
% display chunk of waveform
% 6. demodulate 
% show demodulated chunk?

% 7. full show receieved frame
